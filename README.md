# Battery threshold extension
GNOME shell 43 extension to set a battery threshold on some Asus laptop! 

Based on the work of https://github.com/francku
Original extension: https://github.com/francku/gnome-shell-extension-battery-threshold

This extension uses "pkexec" since sudo permissions are needed to change the threshold level.
